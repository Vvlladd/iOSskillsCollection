# Attribution

`swift-tdd` is a derivative work of the `tdd` skill from
[**mattpocock/skills**](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), used and modified
under the MIT License.

## What came from upstream

The conceptual frame: the definition of a good test, **seams** as the place tests
belong, the three anti-patterns (implementation-coupled, tautological, horizontal
slicing), and the rules of the red → green loop. Several passages are lightly
edited from the original prose.

## What was added here

Swift Testing idioms (`@Test`, `#expect`, `#require`, `confirmation`, traits,
parameterized cases); the Swift seam table; guidance on `@testable import` as a
smell; the async anti-pattern; `swift test` / `xcodebuild test` invocation; and a
complete rewrite of the mocking reference around protocol conformance, closure
doubles, and `URLProtocol` — Swift has no runtime mocking, so the original's
`jest.mock` material did not carry over.
